# Programming for Data Analysis Assignments

## Contents of the repository -

This repository contains a notebook used to summarise and outline the uses for the Numpy.Random package available in Python
The list of functions available in this package can be viewed [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.random.html) with in detail descriptions, examples and uses being outlined in the final file within this repository for this assignment. The documentation generated by Scipy has additional descriptions for each of the functions available by clicking each function. *[1]*

The four main objectives of this analysis were to complete the following - 

1) Explain the overall purpose of the package

2) Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3) Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4) Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

To meet the above objectives a jupyter notebook was created which discusses and outlines the functions available in Numpy.Random in detail.

## How to run the notebook -

To run, edit and view this notebook the download option can be used on the dashboard view for this repository. This will download a zip file containing the various Notebooks and files for this assignment. The completed assignment for all details matching the brief above has been named - *"Final Assignment Submission - Discussion and outline of numpy.random package in Python"*.

In order to use this notebook it is required to have the correct packages installed which allow jupyter notebook to be utilised on the machine being used to view this file. The most popular way to install this, and multiple other useful packages, is through the use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). *[2]*

Once the relevant file has been downloaded locally to your machine, and you have installed the packages required to utilise jupyter notebooks, the command jupyter notebook can be ran through any command line interface which you may have installed. This can be ran from your home folder or by using the "cd" command to the folder in which you have downloaded the notebooks files. This will lead to a pop up window of Jupyter notebook to be opened and a list of files in the folder you have ran this command from should appear. Following this you will need to locate the *"Final Assignment Submission - Discussion and outline of numpy.random package in Python"* file on your machine using the file structure in Jupyter notebook.

Once the file has been opened the Cell, run all, commands can be used to re-run any code cells to view the results etc. The various functions which can be used in the jupyter notebooks to view, edit and run the cells, text or code, can be found on their website [here](http://jupyter.org/) *[3]* or through the various cheat sheets available online.
