    "The numpy.random package in python is useful for data analysis due to its ability to generate an array of random numbers using either the \"rand(), randn() or randint()\" functions.\n",
    "​\n",
    "It is particularly useful for hypothesis testing in data analysis due to its ability to provide a test sample of data. Sampling is known to be one of the most important useful factors in determining the accuracy of research during a project. As open source datasets can have a number of outliers or errors it can affect any testing as the results are reflective of the testing and the data used. By ruling out the errors which can be present in open datasets using this package it is more indicative or errors within the hypothesis when testing. This is a major advantage of having access to this package in python for data analysts during testing.\n",
